This repository houses the assignments I had to complete for the course "Quantative Methods for Logistics" (ME44206) at Delft University of Technology.  
I recommend not copying the code directly for the same course as this would violate the TU Delft code of conduct.
I'm not incredibly experienced in Python programming but I would love to learn.

To see the assignments, see "assignment_[number].pdf"

Did I like the assignment? So far, yes! It's a nice puzzle
